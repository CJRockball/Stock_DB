# Stock_DB

This program sets up a database and downloads stock data from Yahoo. It uses a simple web interface built in Flask, where you can download stock history and visualize it. There is no CSRF of flash messages implemented.

Download web_stock_search_db and templates. Make sure you're in the right folder when you run it otherwise the program will not find the database.

First time the program is run it will creat the database stock.db in the same folder as the program. The db has two tables, one for name and length of the time series and one for the data.
